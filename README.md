# PyZon

## Overview
PyZon is a Python-based project designed to interact with the Amazon Product Advertising API (PAAPI). It allows users to perform product searches and retrieve detailed product information through a command-line interface. This project is set up to handle various systems and their peculiarities, especially in the context of network operations and input handling.

## Features
- **Character-by-character input handling**: Custom implementation to read single characters without echoing them to standard input.
- **Network request handling**: Custom logic to handle URL fetching and to circumvent App Engine quirks.
- **Amazon PAAPI Integration**: Search and retrieve product information from Amazon using PAAPI.
- **Logging**: Configured logging for better traceability of operations.

## Installation Instructions
To set up and run PyZon, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/pyzon.git
   cd pyzon
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 2.5 or above. Install necessary Python packages (if any are listed in requirements.txt or similar documentation):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set Up Amazon Credentials**:
   Edit the `paa.py` file to include your Amazon Associate Tag, AWS Key, and AWS Secret:
   ```python
   ASSOCIATE_TAG = "<your associate tag>"
   AWS_KEY = "<your aws key>"
   AWS_SECRET = "<your aws secret>"
   ```

## Usage Examples
To use PyZon, run the `productproto.py` script. This script will take user input character by character and perform search operations using the PAAPI:
```bash
python productproto.py
```

Example:
```python
# Initiate a search
# Type product keywords and see results in real-time.
```

## Code Summary
### Directory Structure
- `getch.py`: Implements single-character input reading for both Windows and Unix-based systems.
- `net.py`: Handles URL fetching, with special handling for Google App Engine.
- `paa.py`: Contains integration logic for Amazon's Product Advertising API and product-related classes.
- `productproto.py`: Main script for running the command-line interface to interact with PAAPI.
- `__init__.py`: An empty file to mark this directory as a Python package.

### Key Files
- **`getch.py`**: Provides `_Getch` class for reading single characters without echoing to stdout.
- **`net.py`**: Manages network operations and includes workaround for App Engine's quirky behavior with `urllib2`.
- **`paa.py`**: Defines the `Product` class and handles API interactions, including signing requests and parsing XML responses.
- **`productproto.py`**: Entry-point script that uses the `getch` and `paa` modules to perform real-time product searches.
